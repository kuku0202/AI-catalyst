'''
You have the user goal:
"""
{query}
"""

You web search method is:
"""
{}
"""

Your goal is to find unexplored research directions related to your {topic} by analyzing existing related papers and identifying gaps, limitations, or new opportunities.

Respond in the following format:

THOUGHT:
<THOUGHT>

RESPONSE:
```json
<JSON>
```

In <THOUGHT>, follow these steps:
1. Briefly understand the topic and its key components
2. Use MCP server tools to search for 5 relevant papers based on the topic, avoiding papers already in {history}
3. For each paper found, analyze:
   - What methods/approaches they used
   - What problems they solved
   - What limitations or gaps they mention
   - What future work they suggest
   - What assumptions they made that could be challenged
4. Look for patterns across papers to identify:
   - Common limitations or unsolved problems
   - Unexplored combinations of approaches
   - New applications or contexts not yet studied
   - Emerging trends or technologies not yet applied

In <JSON>, respond with a LIST of papers in JSON format. Each paper should have these fields:
- "url": Paper URL
- "paper_summary": Summary of their work and key findings
- "what_it_correlates_to_our_topic": Paper relates to your research topic
- "limitations": Limitations and unsolved problems in the paper
- "novel_directions": New research directions that could emerge from this work or solve the limitations in the paper

IMPORTANT: Return a LIST of papers, not a single paper. Find 5 different papers that are not in the history.

Focus on identifying concrete, actionable research gaps rather than just summarizing papers. Look for opportunities to combine different approaches or apply methods to new contexts.

Do not find the same paper in the history, {history}.

This JSON will be automatically parsed, so ensure the format is precise.
